# Caching examples with Netlify

The goal is to test the caching capabilities of Netlify.

You can find the live demo at [https://cache-examples.netlify.app/](https://cache-examples.netlify.app/).

Currently, the following caching strategies are tested:

- [x] Netlify's blob storage
- [ ] Netlify's build cache
- [ ] Netlify's edge caching
- [ ] Netlify's cdn caching
