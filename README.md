# Caching examples with Netlify

The goal is to test the caching capabilities of Netlify.

You can find the live demo at [https://cache-examples.netlify.app/](https://cache-examples.netlify.app/).

## Instalation

- copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values
- run `npm/pnpn/yarn install`

Currently, the following caching strategies are tested:

- [x] Netlify's blob storage
- [x] Netlify's build cache
- [x] Netlify's edge caching
- [ ] Netlify's cdn caching
